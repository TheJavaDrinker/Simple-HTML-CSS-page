                <p class='prod-desc-desc'>Consoles have advantages over PCs: They are easy to use, don't require upgrades, make for simple multiplayer with console-owning friends, are generally cheaper, and use wireless controllers that allow you to have a more active experience.Another advantage of console gaming is you can keep playing your games without worrying about hardware becoming obsolete. Unlike playing on a PC, which can require upgrades as PC games advance, consoles are built by the manufacturer with the necessary system requirements. However, console manufacturers will release new consoles in line with improvements in technology, so there is still a risk of old consoles not being supported for new games. The amount of time between <a href="/" class='desc-link'>new console</a> releases depends on the manufacturer. So, console gamers will have to consider whether to upgrade or not when the latest system is released.</p>
